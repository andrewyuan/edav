### The 2014 Fifa World Cup

With the kickoff of the 2014 Fifa World Cup fast approaching, soccer fans Shiya and Andrew are obsessed with same question to which every soccer fan on the planet is dying to find out the answer: Who will capture the coveted trophy? What makes the waiting less unbearable for Shiya and Andrew is their scheme to use the tools that they are learning in the data sciences program at Columbia to answer the million-dollar question before the games even start.

The 2014 Fifa World Cup is scheduled to take place from June 12 to July 13, and will be hosted in 12 different cities across Brazil. As the [CNN](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1075786) nicely summarized, _"The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil is shaping up to possibly be the most watched sporting event in history. Both in terms of participants and viewers, soccer is hands down the world's most popular sport."_

Here is a little bit background information on the rules of the game for those of us (mostly just the Americans) who are not as soccer-savvy as the rest of the world. The World Cup takes place every 4 years, and 32 teams out of 207 teams from all around the world advance into the tournament after 820 qualifying matches, which, this year, started on June 2011 and ended on November 2013. Each team brings 23 players to proudly represent its country and participate in the most popular sporting event in the world.

The competition is divided in two main stages, the **Group Stage** and the **Knockout Stage**.


### The Group Stage

The 32 qualified teams were divided into 8 groups through a random draw that happened on January 6 of 2013. During this stage, the teams of each group will play against each other, and the top 2 teams of each group will advance in the next round.


### The Knockout Stage

In this stage,16 out of the 32 qualified teams continue their quest for the championship. Four more rounds of matches are what separate them from the ultimate trophy, and they are Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semi-finals, and Final. 

The winners of each match advances to the next round, and the losers, very sadly, go home. The final winner of the 4 rounds will be declared as the champion.


### The Prediction

Based on data on historical matches and the Fifa Ranking, we estimated the probability of each team advancing through the different stages and rounds of the competition, and eventually becoming the champion. We modeled the probability estimate of a match result, and then simulated the probabilities for all 32 teams during all stages of the World Cup.
