### The 2014 Fifa World Cup

With the kickoff of the 2014 Fifa World Cup fast approaching, soccer fans Shiya and Andrew are obsessed with same question to which every soccer fan on the planet is dying to find out the answer: Who will capture the coveted trophy? What makes the waiting less unbearable for Shiya and Andrew is their scheme to use the tools that they are learning in the data sciences program at Columbia to answer the million-dollar question before the games even start.

The 2014 Fifa World Cup is scheduled to take place from June 12th to July 13th, and will be hosted in 12 differenct cities accross Brazil. Quoting [CNN's ireport](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1075786), _"The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil is shaping up to possibly be the most watched sporting event in history. Both in terms of participants and viewers, soccer is hands down the world's most popular sport."_

It takes place every 4 years, and 31 teams out of 207 teams accross the globe qualified for the tournament after 820 qualifying matches that started on June 2011 and ended on November 2013 (the host is automatically qualified). Each team will bring 23 players to represent their countries in the most popular sporting event in the world.

The competition is divided in two main stages, the **Group Stage** and the **Knockout Stage**.


### The Group Stage

The 32 qualified teams were divided in 8 groups through a random draw that happened on 2013, January 6th. During this stage, the teams of each group will play agains each other, and the top 2 teams of each group will advance to the next round. 


### The Knockout Stage

16 teams out of the 32 advance to this stage, which is divided in 4 rounds of matches:
* Round of 16
* Quarter-finals
* Semi-finals
* Final

The winners of each match advance to the next round, and losers go home. The ultimate winner of the 4 rounds will be declared the champion.


### The Prediction

Based on historical matches results data and the Fifa Ranking table, we estimated the probability of each team advancing through the different stages and rounds of the competition, and ultimately becoming the champion. We modeled the probability estimate of a match result, and then simulated the entire World Cup.
