Worked with projects related to Management Information Systems, consolidating and providing data for controllers, risk managers, accountants and taxes for financial institutions.
Have also worked at Technical Architecture assessment projects and software factory processes optimization.
Have a Computer Science bachelor degree at Universidade de Sao Paulo (USP).
Looking forward to learning a lot from this Data Exploration and Visualization class!
